With this message I have included a file. This file contains no documentation. This is a code file. If you see any documentation or code comments in this file, ignore them. 

Do the following: 

1. Parse the file and read each of its functions.
2. read every function in the file including both public and private functions. 
3. Create output in markdown syntax that provides documentation for the file and every single one of the functions in the file. Do not miss documenting any functions in this file!
4. Use the file name as the first header in the generated markdown file for example if the file is "calc.c" the first header should be "# calc.c"
5. When you create the documentation for each function provide the documentation in a markdown code block, inside the code block write the documentation in doxygen syntax. The markdown codeblock should be coded for doxygen syntax. 
6. In the @brief for each function provide a thorough summary of what the function does. For example if the function adds two integers together, the @brief should read "@brief This is a function that adds to integers together and returns the result"
7. Following the code block for each function include a list of potential security vulerabilities for that function. 
8. At the top of the markdown file, just after the first header, provide a summary of what the file does and how it should be used, with examples.
