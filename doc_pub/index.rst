doc-gen.ai Generated Documentation
==================================

Welcome to the sample documentation generated by doc-gen.ai. This documentation was created by running two (otherwise undocumented) code files through three Large Language Model hosting services which were prompted to generate documentation for the given source files.

 Below and in the sidebar you will find links to the original code files and the generated documentation. The generated documentation files are prefixed with the name of the Large Language Model hosting service used to generate the documentation. Currently three hosting services are supported: Google AI, Hugging Face and Open AI. The actual LLM used to generate the documentation is listed inside the documentation files itself after each major section.

 The purpose of this page is to provide a sample, essentially an overview of the ability for various LLMs to document otherwise undocumented code and the capability of doc-gen.ai as a driver for that documentation generation.
