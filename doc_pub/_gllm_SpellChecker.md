### Description of the Java Spell Checker

The provided Java source file contains a basic spell checker program that does the following:

- It identifies misspelled words in a text file.
- It suggests possible corrections for misspelled words.
- It generates alternative spellings by adding, removing, or swapping characters in the misspelled word.

The program uses a dictionary of correctly spelled words to check against the words in the input text file. Misspelled words are stored in a map along with the line numbers where they appeared.

The spell checker employs three techniques to generate alternative spellings for misspelled words:

- **addChar**: Adds a character anywhere in the word.
- **removeChar**: Removes a character from anywhere in the word.
- **xchangeChar**: Swaps adjacent characters in the word.

The program outputs the misspelled words along with the lines where they appeared, as well as a list of possible corrections.

**Overall, this program is a basic but functional spell checker that demonstrates string manipulation and data structure usage in Java.**

## Security Vulnerabilities: SpellChecker.java
### Possible Issues in Java Spell Checker Source

The provided Java spell checker source has the following possible issues:

**Exceptions:**

- The `checkWords` method throws a `FileNotFoundException` if the input text file cannot be found. This exception is not handled within the method, so it will propagate to the caller.
- The `loadDictionary` method also throws a `FileNotFoundException` if the dictionary file cannot be found. This exception is not handled within the method, so it will propagate to the caller.

**Security Vulnerabilities:**

- The program does not perform any input validation on the input text file or the dictionary file. This means that malicious users could provide specially crafted input files that could cause the program to crash or behave unexpectedly.

**Other Issues:**

- The program does not handle duplicate words in the input text file. If a misspelled word appears multiple times, it will only be reported once along with the first line number where it appeared.
- The program does not provide any way to correct the misspelled words. It only reports the misspelled words and possible corrections.

**Recommendations:**

- The program should handle the `FileNotFoundException`s thrown by the `checkWords` and `loadDictionary` methods to prevent the program from crashing if the input files cannot be found.
- The program should perform input validation on the input text file and the dictionary file to prevent malicious users from providing specially crafted input files.
- The program should handle duplicate words in the input text file by reporting all the line numbers where each misspelled word appears.
- The program could be extended to provide a way to correct the misspelled words, such as by allowing the user to select a correction from a list of suggestions or by providing a way to manually enter the correct spelling.
