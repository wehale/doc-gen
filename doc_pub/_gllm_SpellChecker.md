## Description: SpellChecker.java
### Description of the Java Code

The provided Java code **implements a spell checker that identifies misspelled words in a text document by comparing them against a dictionary**.

**Key Functionality:**

- **Loads a dictionary** from a file into a set of strings.
- **Reads words** from an input text file.
- **Compares each word** to the dictionary.
- **Identifies misspelled words** and stores them along with the line numbers where they occur.
- **Generates possible alternatives** for misspelled words by adding, removing, or exchanging characters.
- **Filters out alternatives** that are not present in the dictionary.
- **Prints a report** listing misspelled words, line numbers, and possible alternatives.

**How it Works:**

1. The `SpellChecker` class is initialized with the loaded dictionary.
2. The `checkWords` method reads words from the input text file and checks each word against the dictionary. Misspelled words are recorded along with their line numbers.
3. For each misspelled word, the `findAlternatives` method generates possible alternatives and filters out invalid ones.
4. The `main` method loads the dictionary, creates a `SpellChecker` instance, and checks for misspelled words in the input text file.
5. The results are printed, including misspelled words, line numbers, and possible alternatives.

**Usage:**

To use the spell checker, you need to provide two command-line arguments:

1. Input text file containing the text to be checked.
2. Dictionary file containing the list of words to use for checking.

The program will analyze the input text file, identify misspelled words, and suggest possible alternatives.

## Functions: SpellChecker.java
### Function and Method Documentation

**Class:** `SpellChecker`

**Constructor:**

- `SpellChecker(Set<String> dic)`: Initializes the `SpellChecker` with the provided dictionary.

**Methods:**

- `checkWords(String inFile)`:
   - **Reads** words from the input file specified by `inFile`.
   - **Checks** each word against the dictionary and identifies misspelled words.
   - **Stores** misspelled words and their line numbers in the `misspelled` map.
   - **Prints** the list of misspelled words, the lines where they occur, and possible alternatives.

- `findAlternatives(String word)`:
   - **Attempts** to find alternative spellings for a given misspelled word.
   - **Generates** possible alternatives by adding, removing, or exchanging characters in the word.
   - **Filters out** alternatives that are not present in the dictionary.
   - **Returns** a set of valid alternatives for the misspelled word.

- `addChar(String aWord)`:
   - **Generates** alternatives by adding a character at each possible position in the word.

- `removeChar(String aWord)`:
   - **Generates** alternatives by removing a character from each position in the word.

- `xchangeChar(String aWord)`:
   - **Generates** alternatives by exchanging adjacent characters in the word.

**Helper Method:**

- `loadDictionary(Set<String> dic, String dictFile)`:
   - **Loads** a dictionary from a file into the provided `dic` set.

**Main Method:**

- `main(String[] args)`:
   - **Loads** the dictionary from the specified file.
   - **Creates** a `SpellChecker` instance using the loaded dictionary.
   - **Checks** for misspelled words in the input file provided.
   - **Prints** the results, including misspelled words, line numbers, and possible alternatives.

## Security Vulnerabilities: SpellChecker.java
### Possible Issues in the Java Code

**Exceptions:**

- The `checkWords` method **does not handle** `FileNotFoundException` when trying to read the input text file. This could cause the program to crash if the file is not found.
- The `loadDictionary` method **does not handle** `FileNotFoundException` when trying to read the dictionary file. This could cause the program to crash if the file is not found.

**Security Vulnerabilities:**

- The code **does not perform any input validation** on the input text file or the dictionary file. This could allow an attacker to provide malicious input that could cause the program to behave unexpectedly or crash.

**Other Issues:**

- The code **does not handle duplicate words** in the input text file. If a word appears multiple times, it will only be reported once in the output.
- The code **does not provide any way to correct** misspelled words. It only identifies and reports them.

**Recommendations:**

- Handle `FileNotFoundException` in the `checkWords` and `loadDictionary` methods to prevent the program from crashing if the input or dictionary file is not found.
- Implement input validation to prevent malicious input from causing problems.
- Consider handling duplicate words in the input text file by reporting all occurrences or providing a count of occurrences.
- Add a feature to allow users to correct misspelled words.
